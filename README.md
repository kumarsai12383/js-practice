# JavaScript Learning Journey & 2-Month Roadmap 🚀

This repository documents my complete JavaScript learning journey along with
a structured **2-month study plan**.  
My goal is to build strong JavaScript fundamentals, improve logical thinking,
and become ready for **internships and frontend development**.

I follow **freeCodeCamp** for guided learning and practice everything again
in **VS Code** to gain real coding experience.

---

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy

- Learn step by step
- Practice more than reading
- Focus on logic, not memorization
- Use `console.log()` for debugging
- Stay consistent every day

---

## 🛠 Tools Used

- JavaScript (ES6)
- VS Code
- Browser Developer Console
- Git & GitHub
- freeCodeCamp

---

# 🗓️ 2-Month JavaScript Learning Plan

## ⏱ Daily Time Commitment
- **1–1.5 hours per day**
- freeCodeCamp + VS Code practice

---

- Logical conditions
- Functions:
  - Function declaration
  - Parameters & arguments
  - Return values

---

## 🟦 MONTH 2 — Logic Building & Real Usage

### 🔄 Week 5: Objects

**Topics**
- Object creation
- Properties & values
- Accessing data using dot & bracket notation
- Objects inside arrays

**Practice**

- Simple calculator
- Number checker (even/odd, positive/negative)
- Basic to-do logic (console-based)

**Focus**
- Logic building
- Clean code
- Using functions & conditions together

---

### 🔄 Week 8: Revision & Internship Preparation

**Activities**

- Rewrite code without looking
- Practice explaining logic
- Push clean commits to GitHub

**Outcome**
- Strong JavaScript basics
- Improved logical thinking
- Ready to start React or frontend projects

---

## 🎯 Final Goal

By the end of 2 months, I aim to:
- Be confident with JavaScript fundamentals
- Solve basic logic problems independently
- Build small JavaScript projects
- Be prepared for **summer internships**
